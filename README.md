# Python-Hangman
This is a Python-based Hangman game built using the Pygame library. The goal is to guess the hidden word by selecting letters. Incorrect guesses lead to the drawing of the hangman figure. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the figure is fully drawn. Enjoy testing your vocabulary and puzzle-solving skills!
